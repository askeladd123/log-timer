- create a python script that plots summary of all activities
- create a python script that plots logs for each day
- add dependency checks that inform users about requisites
- make subcommands that return scripts
- make `--plot` convenience flag for `get` commands
  - it's simpler to do `log get total --plot` than `log get total | (log script plot-total | python)`
  - also easier to understand
